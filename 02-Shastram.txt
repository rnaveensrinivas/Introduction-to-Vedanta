---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

1. Veda - made of 20000 or odd mantras - four groups - Rik, Yajur, Saama, and Atharvana; Rik - metrical/poetic/padhya; Yajur - Prose composition or Gadhya roopena; Saama - Saama mantras - Geethi roopa - Chanting saama - Saama Gaanam; Atharvana Veda - Atharvana and Angiras Rishi; mantra - refers to vedic composition alone; known as "mantra", meant for enquiry, analysis and assimilation - Mananaath thraayathe ithi mantra - Mananam means your analytical study - thraayateh means, it will protect us if we enquire into that; mere repetition of mantra - helps people; Veda => source of knowledge - treasure house of knoweldge; Vid => to know; Vedana saadhanathwaath veda.Pramaanathwaath veda. Veda's author - Paramashwara - God revealed vedas through Rishis - Rish - to know; Rishathi jaanaathi ithi ishi; Lord has transmitted the vedic teaching to the creation along with creation itself - normal humans can't just absorb it - requires extreme sathwa(visesha upaadhi); Before chanting mantra we remember rishis first - feel gratitude - in SV - savithriyaa rishi, vishvamithra - meter in which it is composed – nishr gayathri chandhah - savithaa devathaa, the deity which is talked about through the mantra; rishi chando devatha smaranam is compulsory – before chanting any vedic mantra which indicates that this particular rishi has received; Rishis are also called Mantra dhrashtaarah - those who have seen the mantras; Vedas are received and transmitted through shabhdha roopa alone - not written - hence no specific script for Samskritam - Sishyas have listen and learn - it is Karnna Parampara and not hastha/likitha paramapara(write otes and give to next gen) - Veda also called Shruthi - came down in karnn parampara - Gurusakaashaath shrooyathe ithi shruthi. Guru upadeshanna shrooyathe ithi shruthi.That which is received by hearing.
Veda - mantra - Shruthi - Supra origin hence called Apaurusheya pramaanam - composition and content are divine; pramaanam => knowledge; all other scriptures are build on top of this layer; this is vaidica sampradaya and we are all Vedicas; 

2. Sootra - Sutras or aphorism - cryptic statement - lots of ideas in capsule form - nutshell statements - Alpaaksharamasandhigdham saaravath vishvathomukham - consists of the vedic teachings only, in a codified form - FUNCTION - codification(classification and rearrangement) and clarification(clarify certain vague statements) - In sootras ideas are culled from various places and arranged topic wise. eg teachings of individual duties - dharma sootrani - teachings of family values - grhya sootranni; teaching of societal welfare - shroutha sootrani(deals with big rituals, prayers, functions - for nation and universal harmony) eg. Gautama Sootraani,Aapasthampa Sootrani,parashara sootrani - compositions are not given out by God - hence Paurusheya Sastram - words belong to author but content is vedas; One meaning of Sootram - "thread" - threads topic of vedas - Veda vaakya kusuma grahthanaath thathwaathsootraanaam. Vedic topics => diff types flower; within sootra they are tied and presented in the form of wonderful garlands; Super cryptic compression - 100 books to 5pages

3. Smrithi - poem/metrical - meaning "remembered wisdom" - Rishis using Vedas and Sootras create elaborate Smrithi - Manu Smrithi, Yagnyavalkya Smrithi, Parashara Smrithi - beautiful arranged on topics of cosmology, how creation arose; duties of humans - goals of life, duties of student, duties of householder, duties of ruler, duties of citizen, duties of males/female - all beautifully classified; Comparing Sootra and Smrithi - implicit ideas are made explicit - clears vagueness - brings hidden ideas to light; Sastram is in i)prose form - contains swara - hence chantable - can be learnt byheart; ii) Cryptic statements or verse - hence easy to remember; iii) poems - Gita poem - chantable - hence philosophy can be chanted; Smrithi granthaalso comes under paurusheya shastram; Sootra and Smrithi - content is divine but composition is human; 

4. Puraanas - magnified further - Smrithi(1:10) then Purana(1:100) - purana meand(ancient but relevant) Puraa abhi navah – puraa means very ancient, navah means ever fresh and relevant even for the 21st century - FUNCTION - codify(rearrange), clarify, concretize, Symbolize, and magnify; - abstract are concretized - audio to audio visual - abstract ideas are personified - concretely presented as storeis - one value of Veda is highlighted as story here with 1K verses) - Harischandra Purana, very elaborate story, but essence is two wrods in Vedas - sathyam vada; Similarly Pithr devo bhava; Most puranas are written by Vyaasacharya - 18Upapuraanas + 18puranas = 36 puranas - most popular one is Bhagavada Purana; 

5. Itihasa - history based literature - ithi - "thus" "in this way"; ha - definitely, doubtlessly; aasa - occured, took place - poems - two itihasa - Ramayanam(Valmiki-24K verses - Rama is presented as model - vedic way of living - Ramasya ayaanam maarga jeevitha reethihi) and Mahabharatham(Vyasacharya-100K verses - story of Bharatha Vamsa Raja - "Maha" => vast literature) - presenting history is not the primary purpose - not pure history, it's just for support - pupose is Vedic teaching - hence history + fiction ; Ravana's 10 heads depics various personality - Raakshasa, ruler, selfish, arrogance... - even Rishis added "masala" .

6. Bhaashyam - commentaries in Samskritam for all the above 5; we not only have commentaries but also sub, sub-sub, sub-sub-sub, .... - Purpose of commentaries - to unlock the scriptures in appropriate manner - else one might develop negative opinion and have misundertandings - there is an appropirate way to unlock - called sampradaya; sampradaya our traditional acharyas have written - called bhaashya granthams, vyaakyaana granthas; prose form; 

Six layers together is Shastram - there is only one goal of Shastram - to accomplish Purushaarthas
