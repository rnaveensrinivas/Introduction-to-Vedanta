Tattvabodha - a small Vedāntik work - by Adi Shankaracharya - a fundamental prose-text - has important terms & terminologies for study of Shastram. 
Purushartha - ((human goals/destination -primary meaning)/(free will/choice/sense of effort)-secondary meaning) 
Prayathanah(Endeavor) - Purusha(human) - Manushya arthaah - Arthaha(meaning/wealth/goal/security)

Word Purushartha subtly indicates that only humans have goals? Why? Because of buddhi(rational, intellect, thinking faculty, judging faculty, reasoning faculty, projecting the future faculty, farsightedness, planning for future, working for the betterment of the future) - we are self conscious - we compare ourselves - we have inferiority and superiority complex - hence planning for betterment/future - Contrastingly, animals live instinctively, not far ahead in future - hence this makes humans superior.

1. Artha - "needs" - meaning Security - all those objects which contribute to your security, your physical survival will come under arthah - food, clothing(even helmet and safety gear), shelter and health - Here living is the primary objective, being useful to society is next. - Security has got layers - first, second, third - example, Humans -needs-> cloth -needs-> washing machine -needs-> stabilizer. Contrastingly, animals also want security, God has given them - special skin and abilities. 

2. Kaama - "wants" - once artha is taken care, we go for kaama - this is not necessary but is enjoyable - all comforts, enjoyment and entertainment. - Animals also seek comfort instinctively - If there is lot of sun, the animals naturally go towards the shade. - human beings, because of his superior intellect, he plans and entertains himself - for many artha purushaartha is itself a struggle - example, no water. 

3. Dharma - an invisible form of wealth - good luck or good fortune or punyam - Adrishtam(Sanskrit) - Adhistam(Tamil) - it is achievable through appropriate method, hence dharma also becomes a human goal. Benefits us in present and next life - present(by giving artha & kaama) - future(giving good parents & childhood, since in this stage we have no control) - Dharma decides the parentage, environment, food, clothing, shelter, human values - Study shows initial few years affects the future adult life(physically, emotionally, intellectually, and psychologically)

Dharma Artha Kaama (Dharma is subtle and hence placed first), - these three have many things common - they are earnable - hence called Preyaha - Mogah 

4. Moksha - Mukthi - Shreyah - Moksha is internal freedom - Freedom from what? Slavery. Slavery with regards to Preyah - how is it Enslavement? - happens in two ways - presence or absence of Preyah - things bind me, by their presence, by creating a burden/strain and by their absence creates a vacuum - Moksha is freedom from this slavery, self-mastery, no more daasah to Preyah, one becomes a Swami - Swamithwam is an internal condition, and what does it mean? When things are absent, I don’t feel a vacuum, when things are present they are not burdensome to me - moksha is “I am comfortable with and without dharmaarthakaama" This inner (strength/maturity/mastery) is called moksha.

First three are only secondary purushartha and the last one alone is the primary purushartha.
