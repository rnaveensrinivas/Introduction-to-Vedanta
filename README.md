### 3. **Transcript Book**
   In addition to the audio and summaries, this repository also includes a **transcript book** of Swami Paramarthananda’s lectures. The transcript book contains the full text of his lectures. It is an excellent resource for those who prefer reading over listening.

## How I Used This Repository

- I split my desktop into two windows, one playing the lecture and other having the transcript.
- While the audio is playing, I would follow the transcript line by line(like live captions)
- The transcipt reader I used was Microsoft Edge, which provides highlighting feature, since I like to highlight important points.
- Once a lecture is complete, I use the transcript to create a concise summary.
- Then to refine it and make the English better😅, I pass it through ChatGPT, for final version.
- The ChatGPT version appears first, then my concise summary next within the summary text files.
 to the audio recordings in the **Audio** folder to hear Swami Paramarthananda's teachings.

## Acknowledgments

- I would like thank **Sushrut Vinayak Anna** for introducing me to Swmaiji. 
- Special thanks to **Swami Paramarthananda** for his inspiring and transformative teachings.
- Thanks to **Smt. Viji Natarajan** making the transscript that I was fortunate to find.

_That is Whole and this is Whole, the perfect has come out of the perfect; having taken the perfect from the perfect, only the perfect remains. Let there be Peace, Peace, Peace. (This shanti-sloka of the Isavasyopanishad indicates the relation of the individual’s soul to the divine supreme spirit)._
